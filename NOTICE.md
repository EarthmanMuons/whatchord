# NOTICE

This project includes code and assets originally developed by third-parties.

## assets/fonts/BravuraText.otf

This project includes the **Bravura Text** font, which is distributed as font
software and is used directly for rendering SMuFL-compliant musical glyphs
(e.g., accidentals) in chord identification output.

The font is included unmodified from the following upstream source:

- [BravuraText.otf](https://github.com/steinbergmedia/bravura/blob/02e8ed29a29115df35007d1178cebaeee26c20e1/redist/otf/BravuraText.otf)

**Copyright (c) 2019, Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH  
(<http://www.steinberg.net/>), with Reserved Font Name "Bravura".**

Bravura Text is distributed under the terms of the
[SIL Open Font License (OFL) version 1.1](https://openfontlicense.org/open-font-license-official-text/).

A copy of the license text is included below.

## assets/glyphs/keyboard_pedal_ped.svg

This SVG is a derivative artwork extracted from the **Leland** font, and is not
itself distributed as font software. The glyph was derived from the following
upstream source:

- [Leland.otf](https://github.com/MuseScoreFonts/Leland/blob/d91cf5d21045e2c294541676ad386b7ffb4ac881/Leland.otf)

Original font copyright:

**Copyright (c) 2025, MuseScore BVBA  
(<http://www.musescore.org/>), with Reserved Font Name "Leland".**

Leland is distributed under the terms of the
[SIL Open Font License (OFL) version 1.1](https://openfontlicense.org/open-font-license-official-text/).

## assets/soundfonts/generaluser-gs-v2.0.2-grand-piano.sf2

This project includes a modified subset of the **GeneralUser GS** SoundFont by
S. Christian Collins, used for MIDI-based audio rendering and playback.

The distributed SoundFont file was derived from the upstream GeneralUser GS
v2.0.2 release (archive: `GeneralUser_GS_v2.0.2--doc_r4.zip`) and has been
modified to include only the _Grand Piano_ preset and its associated samples.
All other presets and instruments from the original SoundFont have been removed.
No additional samples were added.

This modified subset is not affiliated with or endorsed by S. Christian Collins.

The original SoundFont is available from:

- <https://schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php>

**Copyright (c) 1997-2025, S. Christian Collins**

GeneralUser GS is distributed under its own license terms. A copy of the license
text is included below exactly as provided in the upstream distribution.

## GeneralUser GS License

```
*** GeneralUser GS v2.0.1 ***
***      License v2.0     ***

** License of the complete work **
You may use GeneralUser GS without restriction for your own music creation,
private or commercial. This SoundFont bank is provided to the community free of
charge. Please feel free to use it in your software projects, and to modify the
SoundFont bank or its packaging to suit your needs.

** License of contained samples **
GeneralUser GS inherits the usage rights of the samples contained within, all of
which allow full use in music production, including the ability to make profit
from musical recordings created with GeneralUser GS.

Many of the samples are original, but some were taken from other banks freely
(and legally) available on the Internet from various SoundFont websites. Because
GeneralUser GS originated as a personal project with no intention for
publication, I cannot be 100% sure where all of the samples originated, although
I do know that none of them came from commercially published SoundFont packages
or sample CDs. Regardless, many "free" SoundFonts available on the web may
indeed contain samples of questionable origin. My understanding of the
copyrights of all samples is only as good as the information provided by the
original sources. If you become aware of any restricted samples being used in
GeneralUser GS, please let me know so I can replace them.

This uncertainty may concern you if you intend to use GeneralUser GS in a
commercial software product. That being said, I have never received any
complaint regarding sample ownership since I published the original GeneralUser
GS back in 2000, and as far as I am aware, neither have any of the companies
creating commercial software products using GeneralUser GS.

** More info **
If you plan to feature GeneralUser GS on your own website, please do not link
directly to my download files. Either link to my website, or provide your own
local copy instead.

I hope you enjoy GeneralUser GS! This SoundFont bank is the product of many
years of hard work.

Thank you!

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide

redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved

however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
