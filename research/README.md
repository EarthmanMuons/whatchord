# Research

Applied research that shapes WhatChord's analysis engine. App code answers "how
does the feature work"; the documents here answer "how do we know it is right"
by testing the engine's musical judgments against external corpora, other tools,
and published methods.

## Standalone studies

- [Chord Naming Oracle Comparison](chord-oracle-comparison.md): comparing
  WhatChord's chord names against music21, tonal, and pychord to surface edge
  cases worth musical review.
- [Chord Coverage From ChoCo](choco-chord-coverage.md): checking WhatChord's
  supported chord families against a large public corpus of real chord
  annotations.
- [Contrapunctus Benchmark Comparison](contrapunctus-benchmark-comparison.md):
  evaluating root identification and surfaced alternatives against a
  Roman-numeral analysis corpus.

## Initiatives

- [WhatKey](whatkey/): automatic key (tonal center) detection from live playing,
  studied as streaming key estimation with abstention and written up as a
  preprint. It holds the design plan, evaluation protocol, dated logs, data
  conventions, and paper in one place.
- [Chord Context](chord-context/): using recently played chords to improve live
  chord naming (contextual re-ranking, contextual spelling, display stability,
  and a gate for rootless/ensemble voicings). Draft proposal; the protocol is
  not yet frozen.

Supporting code lives with the rest of the project: batch drivers and corpus
tooling in `tool/`, performance benchmarks in `benchmark/`, and the engine
itself under `packages/whatchord/`.
