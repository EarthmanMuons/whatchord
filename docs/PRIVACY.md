# Privacy Policy

**WhatChord** ("the App") is provided as a free application. This Privacy Policy
describes how the App handles information when you install and use it.

## Summary

- The App does **not** collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data.
- The App contains **no advertisements**.
- The App does **not** use analytics, tracking, or third‑party data collection
  services.
- All processing occurs **locally on your device**.

## Information Collection and Use

The App does **not** collect any personally identifiable information or usage
data.

Specifically:

- No account creation is required.
- No names, email addresses, identifiers, or contact information are collected.
- No usage analytics, diagnostics, or telemetry are transmitted.
- No data is sold, shared, or disclosed to third parties.

## Device Permissions

The App may request access to certain device features solely to provide its core
functionality:

- **Bluetooth**: Used to connect to external MIDI devices. Bluetooth access is
  not used for location tracking or deriving location data.

These permissions are used only while the App is running and are not used to
collect or transmit data.

## Data Storage

The App stores a limited set of **non‑personal application preferences** locally
on your device in order to preserve settings between sessions.

These preferences may include, for example:

- User interface preferences (such as color scheme or display options)
- The most recently connected external MIDI device

This information:

- Is stored **locally on the device only**
- Is **not personally identifiable**
- Is **not transmitted off the device**
- Is **not shared with the developer or third parties**

The App provides a **Reset to Defaults** option that allows you to clear all
saved preferences and MIDI settings at any time. All locally stored preferences
are also removed if the App is uninstalled.

The App does not store personal data on remote servers.

## Third‑Party Services

The App does not integrate with third‑party analytics, advertising networks, or
data collection services.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including
children under the age of 13.

## Security

Because the App does not collect or transmit data, there is no personal
information at risk of unauthorized access.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be
reflected in this document and published with the App's source repository and
releases.

## Contact

If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, you may contact the
developer via the project repository.
